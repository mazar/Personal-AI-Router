// codec, the cluster mesh, the outbound transport pool, the scheduler baseline.
//
// One Proxy hosts a facade per enabled engine, keyed by engine id, and they run
// concurrently — see spec.md §3. That is what makes the ownership question
// below a correctness question rather than a stylistic one: a field on the
// wrong side is either duplicated state two engines will disagree about, or
// shared state one engine can corrupt for the other.
//
// Ownership rule for anything added here: a field belongs to the facade if two
// engines would each need their own, and to Proxy if a second copy would be
// wasteful or actively wrong. Listeners are per facade because the ports
// differ. The transport pool is per process because it is keyed by peer, not
// by engine, and duplicating it would double the connections to every peer.
