# Microservice: Engine Proxy (`nvpair-proxy`)

> Where this file and `README.md` disagree, this file wins.

## 1. Purpose

Carries inference **to** the node that should serve it. One process hosts a
**facade** per enabled engine: each facade is an HTTP reverse proxy speaking its
engine's own dialect, filtering to nodes that advertise the requested model,
choosing among them, and failing over when one refuses.

It is a data plane, not a policy component. Ranking belongs to
`nvpair-job-scheduler`, and cluster membership and trust to
`nvpair-cluster-manager`. `nvpair-engine-manager` owns an engine's *install and
process* lifecycle; the per-request *workload* lifecycle events in §5.5 are this
process's own. What it owns beyond those events is the choice of *which
advertised owner receives this request*, and the local accounting that makes
that choice good under bursts.

### 1.1 What a caller is promised

The proxy aims to get every inference request **started** on some node that can
serve it, and spends a bounded amount of effort doing so. Stated precisely:

> While budget remains (§5.1), a failure that happens *before* the engine begins
> producing output is retried rather than returned. Once output begins, the
> request is committed to that node and is the caller's to finish with.

Failures absorbed that way include a retryable status, a transport error, an
engine that answers its headers and then produces nothing, and a target that
leaves discovery mid-request. Waiting for an owner to *exist* costs no attempt
at all, so a node blinking out does not spend the budget.

Four things bound that aim, and a caller should design for them.

**Effort is bounded, and which bound ran out changes what the caller gets.**
Absorption holds only while budget remains. Past that there are two shapes, both
detailed in §5.4:

- **The dispatch budget ran out.** The final permitted attempt is never
  retried, so its own failure is the answer: the upstream's status and body
  passed through unchanged, or a `502` if it failed at the transport and a
  `504` if it answered and produced nothing.
- **The deadline passed between attempts, or no owner came back.** Nothing is
  in flight to answer, so the proxy generates a `503` with `Retry-After` that
  names which of those it was.

Either way this is a persistent, bounded attempt to start — not an assurance
that every submission eventually runs.

**"Started" is the guarantee, not "finished".** Commitment ends at the first
byte of response body (§5.2), so `completed` means the engine began generating,
not that a whole answer arrived.

**A truncated stream still reports `completed`**, for two reasons that compound.
To the caller it is the same situation either way — it holds partial output and
is the only party that can decide what to do with it, which is what the
retrying harness above this layer is for. And the proxy genuinely cannot tell a
truncated stream from a complete one: a streaming response carries no
`Content-Length`, and the end-of-turn marker is engine-specific, so recognising
it would mean parsing response bodies, which §9 forbids.

**A non-streaming request is the weakest case.** Its headers arrive only when
the response is complete, so "queued inside the engine" and "generating right
now" look identical from outside. The attempt cap therefore has to cover whole
generation, and when it expires the proxy cannot tell whether it abandoned a
stalled request or a working one — so retrying may discard real progress. That
is a genuine limitation, not a safety margin (§5.6).

## 2. Scope

**In scope**

- One listener per enabled engine, serving loopback plaintext for local clients
  and pin-gated cluster mTLS for peers on the same port.
- Model-owner filtering, target precedence, and retryable failover.
- Per-request workload lifecycle events.
- The process-wide reservation map that makes concurrent dispatch spread.
- The persisted per-engine port a user chose through `set-port`.

**Out of scope**

- Deciding node rank (scheduler), membership or pinning (cluster-manager),
  engine install/start/stop (engine-manager).
- Any cryptography of its own: it consumes the trust fabric, never builds it.
- Model search or catalog browsing.

## 3. Process model

The process starts with **no engine and no listener**. The broker then sends one
`facade/enable` per engine, carrying that engine's port and any alias addresses.

A flag cannot express this. The broker plans a different port for each engine —
Ollama's managed facade wants `:11434` while LM Studio's wants `:1234`, and
either may be absent so the child keeps its own persisted port — and a
single-valued flag carries only one plan.

An engine marked as **riding another engine's facade** (`SharedFacade` in the
shared engine table) is planned differently: the broker sends no `facade/enable`
for it at all. Its route table, model naming, and inventory are attached to the
facade it rides when that facade is enabled, so its models are served through
the same listener and the model name decides which local backend receives the
request. Enabling a riding engine directly is refused with a message naming the
facade to enable instead.

### 3.1 Why one process

Between scheduler snapshots a facade takes short-lived **reservations** for work
it has dispatched but that the scheduler has not yet observed. Those live in the
process, and every facade shares them. If each engine had its own proxy
process, neither could see the other's reservations, so simultaneous bursts of
Ollama and LM Studio requests could both select the same node, each incorrectly
believing it was idle.
Sharing the map is the reason the engines share a process.

### 3.2 What sharing costs

**Shared fate on the process.** A crash takes every facade down; the supervisor
restarts them together and the crash is reported once, against the process.

Inside the process the boundaries are finer, and deliberately so:

| Failure | Blast radius |
| --- | --- |
| Bind race lost on enable | That engine only; reported so the broker can retry elsewhere |
| Port cannot be re-listened | That engine only; its ownership gate is released |
| Panic handling a request | That request only; logged with stack, answered as an internal error |
| Process crash or exit | Every facade |

The first three failures are contained within their listed boundaries. Only a
process crash or exit takes down every facade. Containment matters here in a way
it would not for a single-engine process: one engine's bind race must not take
another engine's working listener with it.

## 4. Addressing

Every facade-scoped message carries the engine it concerns, in both directions.
Without it the engine would be implied by which process a message travelled
through, which is precisely the property one process destroys.

The address is a bare engine id (`ollama:ready`), deliberately **not** the
component name (`ollama-proxy:ready`). The component form is how a client
addresses the component through the broker; the two meet in the broker's relay,
which takes one off and puts the other on.

| Class | Addressed? | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facade-scoped | yes | `ready`, `error`, `node/*`, `errors:*`, `set-port`, `discovery:subscribe`, `discovery:nodes` |
| Process-scoped | no | `log/set-level`, `node/set-priority`, `workload:*`, `discovery:node-activity` |
| Bootstrap | names its engine in the payload | `facade/enable` |

`facade/enable` is unaddressed because it runs *before* the facade it names
exists. Only a known engine id counts as an address: plenty of unaddressed
methods contain a colon, so treating `errors:report` as engine `errors` would
strip a real method down to `report`.

An unaddressed facade-scoped message resolves to **no** facade. Falling back to
"the only facade" would work with one engine enabled and misroute silently with
two.

## 5. Request path

For a model-bearing inference request:

1. Filter a request-local discovery snapshot to nodes whose per-engine inventory
   advertises the requested model. Ollama normalizes the implicit `:latest` tag;
   LM Studio ids and OpenAI-compatible server ids match exactly. A facade also
   grants its riding engines' models to the same candidate set, so a model
   served by a node's OpenAI-compatible server is eligible through the Ollama
   facade. An empty owner set returns a local `502` without
   contacting an engine.
2. Order the eligible owners: explicit `node/select` pin, then the scheduler's
   priority list, then deterministic default ordering.
3. Reserve the least estimated-loaded scheduler-listed candidate and move it to
   the front (§6).
4. Forward, failing over through the remaining candidates on a retryable status
   or transport error. An upstream model `404` counts as retryable, because
   positive inventory can be stale.
5. When a round's candidates are exhausted, back off and re-resolve (§5.1),
   until the dispatch budget or the deadline runs out.

An ineligible manual selection cannot override the capability gate, and failover
never broadens to an excluded node.

Manual nodes are an exception to the riding grant: their probes report only the
managed engines' inventories, so a user-managed OpenAI-compatible server on a
manually added node is never advertised and its models stay unroutable there.

### 5.1 Retry bounds

| Bound | Value | Governs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxDispatchAttempts` | 5 | how many dispatches may fail |
| `jobDeadline` | 10 minutes from request creation | how long new attempts may keep being started, including while waiting for an owner to exist |
| `firstBodyTimeout` | `proxyResponseTimeout` (120s) | one attempt's wait for first content, measured from the arrival of headers |

The retry budget applies only to inference requests. Routes not classified in
the engine's route table are still forwarded verbatim, and some perform
state-changing operations; for example, `POST /api/pull` starts a model
download. Since any `5xx` is retryable regardless of route, re-resolving and
redispatching such a request could start the operation several times, which is
both non-obvious and wasteful. For a non-inference request the proxy therefore
resolves candidates once and tries each at most once. It does not re-resolve
candidates, back off between rounds, or apply the inference deadline.

**An attempt is consumed by a dispatch, never by a resolution.** Finding no
eligible owner sends nothing, so a job whose only owner briefly drops out does
not burn its budget while the node comes back.

**Elapsed time per attempt is the sum of three budgets, not one.** They run in
sequence: the dial (`proxyDialTimeout`, 10s), then headers
(`proxyResponseTimeout`, 120s, enforced by the transport), then first content
(`firstBodyTimeout`, 120s, which starts only once headers arrive). One attempt
can therefore occupy around 240s — the two 120s caps back to back, since a slow
dial is a LAN rarity — and nothing caps their sum.

Both bounds are checked before every dispatch and **never truncate an attempt
already in flight**. Killing one seconds from its first token and then failing
the job for being out of time would spend the entire wait and discard the
result. `jobDeadline` is therefore a "no new attempts after" line rather than a
ceiling on elapsed time, and the worst case is the deadline plus one whole
attempt: a last dispatch starting just under 600s and running its full 240s
puts time to first content near fourteen minutes.

Which bound ends a job depends on how its attempts fail, and all three cases
are real:

- **Fast failures** — a refused connection, a prompt `503` — cost about a
  second, so all five attempts fit well inside the deadline and the dispatch
  budget is what ends the job. This is the common case.
- **Slow failures** — an engine that accepts and then withholds everything —
  cost close to a whole attempt each, so the deadline arrives first. At 240s
  per attempt the fourth dispatch would start past 600s, so the job ends after
  three attempts with budget unspent.
- **No owner at all** costs no attempt, so the deadline is the only thing that
  can end the wait.

The last case is why the deadline cannot be dropped as redundant with the
attempt count, and the middle one is why five attempts is a ceiling rather than
a promise. **Do not remove either bound as unreachable.**

#### Waiting for an owner

There is no memory of nodes seen in the past: every resolution runs against the
live discovery snapshot, so "eligible owner" always means "advertising this
model right now". What differs is the position in the request's life.

- **No owner at admission** — nothing has been dispatched, so there is nothing
  to wait for being interrupted. Return `502` immediately (§5.4). A model
  nobody advertises will not become servable by waiting.
- **No owner after at least one dispatch** — an owner existed a moment ago and
  went away, so the proxy waits for one to reappear, re-resolving on the backoff
  schedule. This costs no attempt, so `jobDeadline` is the only thing that ends
  it: the deadline *is* the grace period for a node coming back.

The asymmetry is deliberate. Waiting is justified by evidence that a capable
owner existed within this request's lifetime, and nothing weaker.

Candidates are re-resolved every round, so a node that recovered or a model that
finished pulling becomes eligible mid-retry. The same node may be retried — with
one owner, all five attempts go to it.

A requester that has gone away ends the retry immediately: nobody is left to
receive the answer, so the remaining attempts belong to work someone is waiting
for. Its end is reported as `cancelled` and is never attributed to a missing
node.

### 5.2 The commit point

**Commit is the first byte of response body, not the response headers.**

Headers are not a valid commit signal: they may show only that the engine
accepted the request. Treating them as commitment would disable the header
timeout and prevent failover while the request remains queued inside the
engine. The first content byte is the first engine-independent evidence that
generation has begun.

The difference is engine-specific and large. Measured against LM Studio 0.4.x
with a model loaded at `--parallel 1`, probing while a long generation held the
single slot:

| Request | Headers | First body byte |
| --- | --- | --- |
| streaming | 12ms, on accept | 35.5s, when the slot freed |
| non-streaming | 38.9s, withheld until complete | with the headers |

Nothing arrives during that wait — no SSE keepalive, no empty role delta — so a
byte is real content rather than a heartbeat.

**Only the existence of the byte matters, never its value.** The proxy does not
look at it: inspecting content would make the gate engine-specific, and it
would mean reading response data §9 forbids. Whatever the byte is, it is
spliced back onto the front of the stream so the client receives the response
intact.

`EOF` with no bytes counts as a commit. This is defensive rather than expected
— an inference route answering `200` with an empty body is an engine
misbehaving — but treating it as a stall would spend the whole budget waiting
for content that is never coming and then fail a request the engine considered
answered.

A first-content timeout **never** commits, including on the final permitted
attempt, where it is terminal with `504`. Committing there would leave the peek
reader blocked on the same body, racing two readers on one stream, and against
a silent upstream the copy would block with nothing left to interrupt it.

The gate is scoped to inference, and costs a non-streaming response nothing,
since its headers and body arrive together. That is why the request's own
`stream` flag never has to be consulted and no per-dialect default has to be
guessed, and it is what makes the boundary engine-independent — correct whether
an engine withholds headers or sends them on accept.

**After commit there is no retry.** A stream truncated from there is the
caller's to finish with (§1.1).

#### Known gap: a silent upstream after commit

There is no upstream read or idle deadline. If a committed engine keeps the
connection open and stops producing, nothing in this process ends the request:
the client write deadline needs a write to trip, and a silent upstream produces
nothing to write. A *crashed* engine is handled — the copy fails and §5.4's
deferred reporter emits the terminal — but a *frozen* one holds the request
until the client gives up.

Closing it needs a read deadline refreshed on every chunk, and a value chosen
so a slow-but-healthy generation is not cut off mid-answer. That judgement is
not made here.

### 5.3 Per-attempt cancellation

A watcher cancels an attempt promptly when its target leaves discovery.
Otherwise the attempt could stay blocked until the first-content timeout while
the broker's node-loss sweep had already marked the workload failed, so the UI
would report failure while the client was still waiting.

Each attempt runs on a context derived from the request's, and that child
relationship is load-bearing: the disconnect watcher and the outcome
classification both read the *parent*, so cancelling a child cannot be mistaken
for the requester leaving. Confusing the two would either report a job that went
on to succeed as `cancelled`, or let a real disconnect keep burning attempts.

**Commit and cancellation are mutually exclusive, decided by one atomic
claim.** Both can become true at once — the watcher's discovery check can pass
while the commit path is already running, and the work between the arrival of
the first byte and the end of the commit includes a synchronous notification
write and two mutex acquisitions. A pair of signals cannot express which
happened first, so the attempt has a single state that each side claims by
compare-and-swap; the loser becomes a no-op.

**A committed first byte wins that claim.** A delivered byte is direct evidence
that this node is serving this request, whereas an absence from discovery can be
a transient announcement gap. If the watcher claims first the attempt is
abandoned without committing, so the request retries rather than being served a
stream the proxy then truncates itself.

### 5.4 Status handling and outcome classification

Whether a status is retried depends on *when* it arrives, not only on its class.
Before commit the proxy may try elsewhere; at commit the status becomes the
client's answer.

| Upstream status | Pre-commit, budget remaining | Workload state if it is the answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2xx` | commits (§5.2) | `completed` |
| `3xx` | not retried; not expected from an engine, and forwarded verbatim if one sends it | `failed` |
| `4xx` except `404`/`408`/`429` | not retried — the same request fails identically everywhere, so retrying only spends budget | `failed` |
| `404` | retried on an inference route only: positive model inventory can be stale | `failed` |
| `408`, `429` | retried | `failed` |
| `5xx` | retried | `failed` |

Anything not retried commits and becomes the client's answer immediately, with
no further dispatch, whatever budget is left.

These are the statuses the proxy itself returns:

| Condition | Status |
| --- | --- |
| No owner advertises the model, nothing dispatched | `502` |
| Model is advertised only by a facade-riding engine, but the request path is native to the facade engine (`/api/*` inference or Anthropic Messages) and the route grant excludes the rider | `502` with `engine-dialect-mismatch`, naming the model and the OpenAI inference paths on the same port |
| Final permitted attempt returned a status | that status and body, unchanged |
| Final permitted attempt failed at the transport | `502` |
| Final permitted attempt answered but produced no content | `504` |
| The loop ended between attempts, nothing in flight | `503` with `Retry-After` |

The final permitted attempt is never retried, so it answers for itself. That is
why exhausting the dispatch budget does not produce a `503`: the fifth attempt
is the answer. The `503` is for a loop that ended with no attempt to answer,
which means time ran out.

Its body names which, because the two call for different responses from the
caller:

- **the deadline passed while attempts were still failing** — an owner was
  present throughout, and slow attempts reached 10 minutes before they reached
  five dispatches (§5.1);
- **no owner became available** — the candidate set was empty and the wait for
  a node to come back timed out.

A third reason, **every dispatch attempt failed**, guards the case where the
loop ends on the count with nothing having answered. The paths above make that
unreachable today; it is cheap to keep and wrong to rely on.

The resulting workload state:

| Outcome | State |
| --- | --- |
| committed 2xx, streamed to the end | `completed` |
| committed 2xx, truncated by the node dying | `completed` |
| committed non-2xx | `failed` |
| client disconnected, or dead-client write deadline tripped | `cancelled` |
| cancelled by our own shutdown | `cancelled` |
| budget or deadline exhausted pre-commit | `failed` |

`cancelled` distinguishes requester-initiated termination from an actionable
engine, node, or routing failure. Client disconnects and shutdown cancellation
therefore do not appear in the failed bucket.

**Reporting is deferred.** A mid-copy error is never returned to the handler:
`httputil.ReverseProxy` converts it into `panic(http.ErrAbortHandler)` when
running under a real server. That panic bypasses ordinary code following the
proxy call, so terminal workload and request reporting must run in a `defer`.
The deferred reporter records the abort as operational detail, emits the
terminal event, and re-panics so `http.Server` still closes the connection.
Reservation release is also deferred so it survives the same unwind.

That panic is not the failure mode §3.2 describes, despite the shared word.
`http.ErrAbortHandler` is a sentinel `net/http` defines to mean "abandon this
response without logging a stack", and `http.Server` recovers it silently by
contract; re-panicking is how the connection gets closed, and swallowing it
would leave the client waiting on a response that will never be finished.
§3.2's entry covers an *unexpected* panic — a bug — which is logged with its
stack and answered as an internal error.

### 5.5 Workload lifecycle

| Event | When | State | `scheduledOn` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workload:submitted` | admitted | `queued` | empty |
| `workload:submitted` | each dispatch | `queued` | the target |
| `workload:submitted` | between attempts | `queued` | empty |
| `workload:started` | commit | `running` | the node that served |
| `workload:completed` / `workload:errored` | terminal | per §5.4 | unchanged |

`submitted` covers the whole pre-commit life; `started` means the engine is
producing content. That split is forced as well as honest: the broker's store
merges by state rank and rejects a lower one, so a job that claimed `running` at
dispatch time could not return to `queued` for its next attempt and the retry
would be invisible. Keeping the loop inside one state, with `scheduledOn`
carrying the detail, is the only shape that store can represent.

Every event carries `seq`, the producer's event counter from 1. The
workload-manager's inter-node dedup is a permanent set, so a retry returning to
a placement it already used — `queued` on A, cleared, `queued` on A again, which
this loop produces routinely — would otherwise be indistinguishable from a
redelivery and dropped by every peer.

A job admitted but not yet dispatched has no execution node. Consumers must
treat an absent `scheduledOn` as "not placed" rather than assuming a node.

Each event also names the **engine** that will serve (or served) the job. A
model advertised by both engines of one node resolves to the facade engine —
the same collision rule the dispatch itself applies — so the workload's engine
always matches the backend that actually receives the request.

### 5.6 Coverage gap: non-streaming requests

A non-streaming request is the case the retry policy serves worst, and the
weakness is the opposite of too little retrying.

Its headers arrive only when the response is complete, so from outside the
engine "queued behind other work" and "generating right now" are
indistinguishable. The 120s header cap therefore has to cover whole generation
— the first-content wait adds nothing here, since the body arrives with the
headers — and when it expires the proxy retries without being able to tell
whether it just abandoned a stalled request or a working one. A generation
legitimately slower than that cap is restarted elsewhere, discarding real
progress, and the restart faces the same cap.

Nothing in the current engine surface fixes this: there is no progress signal
before the response is complete. A caller that cares should prefer a streaming
request, where the first content byte gives the proxy the evidence it lacks
here.

### 5.7 Accepted behavior

**An abandoned attempt may still run inside the engine.** Neither engine PAIR
supports today exposes a way to withdraw a request it has accepted, and both
queue internally, so a retried job can have more than one copy generating while
the abandoned copy keeps its node busy.

Whether closing the connection cancels anything upstream is **unverified** —
plausible, engine-specific, and never measured. The behavior above is stated as
the pessimistic case for that reason.

This is accepted rather than overlooked: those internal queues are invisible and
un-retargetable, which is the problem the retry policy works around rather than
a mechanism it can build on. Do not reach for engine environment bounds or
occupancy probes to "fix" it — LM Studio exposes no such signal at all, and an
adopted engine keeps its own environment regardless. An engine that did offer a
real cancellation API would change this calculus, and the claim should be
revisited per engine rather than assumed to hold forever.

### 5.8 Browser policy

Each facade preserves its engine's CORS policy, including missing headers and
permission denials. Ingress gates apply before preflight forwarding. Proxy errors
grant no CORS permissions. Multi-target preflights intersect permissions from all
responding engines without forwarding caller credentials; unavailable engines
are skipped, and no responders yields 502. Preflights take no reservations.

Model inventories with an Origin require agreement from every responding engine:
a denial yields 403, an invalid inventory yields 502 without a partial list. An
invalid-inventory error retains CORS headers only when all responding engines
approve. See README.md for the complete forwarding and intersection rules.

## 6. Reservations

A reservation is one in-flight dispatch this process has made since the last
scheduler snapshot. Estimated load for a node is
`pending + gpuPressure + reservations`, the first two from the scheduler.

- **Taken** when a candidate is chosen, unless an eligible manual pin applies,
  and re-taken through the same path on each retry round (§5.1).
- **Moved** to the node an attempt actually targets, because the node that
  refused the request is not doing the work. An attempt can hold a node for the
  whole first-content budget, so the claim follows each dispatch rather than
  waiting for the commit.
- **Released** when the request ends, so a node stops counting as loaded as soon
  as it stops working. Without release a trickle of short requests makes an idle
  node read as busy for the rest of the snapshot interval.
- **Released before every retry backoff**, for the same reason applied to a
  waiting job: between attempts nothing is running, and because the map is
  process-wide a stale claim would push the *other* engine's traffic away from a
  node that is in fact free. This mirrors clearing `scheduledOn`, one being the
  proxy's own estimate and the other the scheduler's.

Each is stamped with the snapshot **generation** it was counted against. A
snapshot supersedes every reservation taken before it — its pending counts
already include that work — so a release naming an older generation is dropped.
Applying it would double-count the completion and drive the node's estimated
load below zero, which reads as permanently idle and attracts every subsequent
dispatch.

`node/set-priority` therefore carries a generation and is applied at most once;
a redelivered snapshot must not clear live reservations.

## 7. Listener personalities

One port per facade, demultiplexed on the connection's first byte:

- **Loopback plaintext** for local clients. A LAN caller is refused.
- **Cluster mTLS** when `--cluster-dir` shows this node is a member: a peer
  whose client certificate matches a local pin is forwarded straight to the
  local engine reported by `node/set-local-backend`, never re-routed onward.

Membership and pins are re-derived per request and on a watch, so joining or
leaving a cluster needs no restart.

An engine with an inherited host variable (today Ollama alone) may also be given
loopback-only **alias** addresses, so clients already using that variable enter
the same routing path. An occupied alias is non-fatal: the existing owner is
untouched, the primary listener stays up, and a warning is reported.

## 8. Ports

| | Ollama | LM Studio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine's own client-facing port | 11434 | 1234 |
| Where PAIR relocates the engine | 11435 | 1235 |
| Standalone port, when `port` is omitted | 11435 | 1234 |
| Persisted-port file | `proxy-port.json` | `lmstudio-proxy-port.json` |

A port chosen at runtime via `set-port` is persisted per engine and restored
when that facade is enabled, taking precedence over the requested port, so the
facade returns where the user left it. `ignorePersistedPort` bypasses that for a
broker-coordinated start.

`port` 0 means "the engine's standalone default". Any other out-of-range value
is rejected rather than honoured as ephemeral: the facade announces the
requested port in `ready`, so binding an ephemeral one would leave the broker
unable to locate it.

## 9. Logging constraints

Never log prompts, chat messages, request bodies, stream chunks, full responses,
credentials, or pairing data. Operational metadata only — engine, model, job id,
node id, path, stream flag, normalized error text — and keep per-request routing
detail below info level.

The log component is the **process** (`nvpair-proxy`), because at process init
there is no engine to name. Facade-scoped records carry an `engine` field, which
is what keeps a line attributable when several facades share the sink.

## 10. Adding an engine

Everything engine-specific is one entry in `engines.go` plus the shared identity
in `nvpair-shared/engines`. A new engine needs: its identity and discovery
service key, its ports and persisted-port filename, its route table and model
normalization, and its empty model-list envelope. It needs no new process, no
new supervisor, and no new relay wiring.

The riding variant needs less: set `SharedFacade` in the shared engine table,
give the facade profile the rider's routes and model naming, and skip the
identity, ports, persisted-port file, and facade enablement entirely — a riding
engine owns no listener and is never announced under its discovery service key.

## 11. Failure modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Requested port taken at enable | Tagged bind failure; broker retries on a fallback port |
| No advertised owner for the model | Local `502`, no engine contacted |
| Rider-only model on a facade-native path | Local `502` `engine-dialect-mismatch` naming the OpenAI inference paths; not an error record, a routing answer |
| All owners refuse retryably | Last upstream status surfaced |
| Transport error with candidates left | Forget the node's confirmed address, fail over |
| Client disconnects mid-stream | Terminal workload event emitted at once; upstream cancelled |
| Broker link closed | Facades stop serving, then the shared transport pool closes |
