// Package engines is the single source of truth for the identity of every
// inference engine PAIR fronts, shared by the proxy, the broker, the scheduler,
// and the TUI.
//
// These values are cross-process contracts, not labels. Name is the engine id
// carried in every engine-manager JSON-RPC call, in the per-engine model
// attribution on a discovery record, on a workload's Engine field, and as the
// basename of the engine-manager manifest that describes how to install and run
// the engine. A mismatch between any two of those does not fail to compile in a
// world where each component spells the id itself — it produces an engine that
// discovers, advertises, and never resolves a model owner. Declaring the set
// once, here, is what turns that class of bug into a build error.
//
// Design decisions this package encodes:
//
//   - Name is lower-case and unpunctuated ("lmstudio", not "lm-studio"). The
//     desktop UI uses its own hyphenated spelling for display types and bridges
//     to this one at the process boundary; that bridge is the only place the two
//     vocabularies are allowed to meet. "openai-compatible" is the deliberate
//     exception: it shipped with one spelling on both sides of the bridge, so
//     EngineManagerNames maps it to itself and there is no second vocabulary
//     to keep in step.
//
//   - A facade-less engine (SharedFacade set) rides another engine's listener
//     instead of having its own. It still takes a full row in this table — its
//     Name is the manifest basename, the discovery model-attribution key, the
//     workload Engine value, and the client-facing relay prefix — but its
//     FacadePort, EnginePortBase and PortFile are zero and meaningless, its
//     DiscoveryService is never registered (inventory reaches peers through the
//     engine-manager's model endpoint and dialing through the facade engine's
//     service key), and every consumer that keys off those fields must check
//     SharedFacade first. Port planning, facade enablement and the TUI proxies
//     view all skip it.
//
//   - There are two proxy identities, and which one a caller wants depends on
//     whether it is naming a *facade* or the *process*.
//
//     ComponentName ("<Name>-proxy") is the per-engine facade identity: the
//     JSON-RPC relay prefix, the error-ID prefix, and the TUI proxies-view tab.
//     These are per-engine because a client addressing "ollama-proxy:nodes/list"
//     or reading an "ollama-proxy:upstream-unreachable" error means that engine,
//     not whichever process happens to serve it.
//
//     ProxyComponent ("nvpair-proxy") is the process identity: the applog
//     component, the subprocess diagnostics name, the supervisor label, and the
//     crash key the TUI health view matches. These belong to the process
//     because one OS process serves every facade, so there is no single engine
//     to attribute them to; logs carry an engine field instead.
//
//     The errors-pipeline *source* deliberately stays per-facade. It is only
//     log context on the broker's side, and knowing which engine reported an
//     error is more useful there than knowing it came from the proxy process.
//
//     The supervisor label and the TUI crash key are matched against each
//     other, so they must move together — the broker stamps its crash id from
//     the label and the health view looks that id up by name. Moving one and
//     not the other is silent in both directions: the crash entry matches no
//     row, and the stale row can never leave "ok". It compiles, and every other
//     test passes. TestHealthProxyRowMatchesTheBrokerCrashIdentity in
//     nvpair-tui/ui is what turns this paragraph into something enforced.
//
//     These were one value until the proxy binary began hosting more than one
//     engine. Ollama's relay prefix was itself once the bare "proxy" while its
//     error IDs were already "ollama-proxy" — two near-identical identities
//     that coincided for LM Studio and diverged for Ollama, which is the trap
//     this package exists to prevent. Keep the distinction explicit: a new
//     identity belongs to the facade or to the process, never to both.
//
//   - FacadePort is the engine's own client-facing default — the port a stock
//     install listens on, and therefore the port PAIR's compatibility proxy
//     claims so existing clients keep working. EnginePortBase is where PAIR
//     relocates the engine to free that port, and the base of the next-free-port
//     search. The two must differ.
//
//   - All is ordered, and Ollama is first. The broker prepares managed ports in
//     this order, and Ollama's preparation reserves any inherited OLLAMA_HOST
//     alias that later engines must route around. Iterating a map here would
//     make that a coin flip and the test that guards it a flake.
