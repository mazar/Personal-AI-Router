# Engine settings protocol

The broker owns combined settings operations for Ollama, LM Studio and the
user-managed OpenAI-compatible engine. Each node owns its own configuration.
`nodeId` selects a discovered, currently pinned peer; omission or the local host
ID selects this node. Bulk propagation is not part of this API.

| Method | Request | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine:get-settings` | `{engine, nodeId?}` | Full snapshot |
| `engine:preview-settings` | `{engine, nodeId?, expectedRevision, settings, resolution?}` | Normalized settings, errors, conflict, restart/rebind summary |
| `engine:apply-settings` | Preview request plus `requestId` | `{revision, phase}` acknowledgement |

`engine` is `ollama`, `lmstudio` or `openai-compatible`. `settings` contains all
three fields: `serverPort`, `proxyPort`, `launchText`. The last field contains
arguments and leading environment assignments, without the executable or startup
subcommand. The argument grammar is
[`pair-arguments-v1`](../nvpair-engine-manager/LAUNCH_TEXT.md). Preview does not
change component configuration or runtime. A snapshot read may persist the
initial revision baseline or reconcile an external component change.

Each full snapshot includes desired `settings`, `revision`, `appliedRevision`,
`phase` (`idle`, `applying`, `succeeded`, `failed`), `requestId`, `error`,
`effectiveServerPort`, `effectiveProxyPort`, `running`, `adopted`, `editable`,
`external`, `reason`, `format`, `epoch`, and `sequence`. A configured runtime
server port does not imply a listening server: consult `running`. The operation
receipt is not a state update. Consume `engine:settings-changed` or fetch the
full snapshot after a response loss. A renderer must retain dirty drafts and
reject stale baseline revisions, even when only arguments changed.

## User-managed engines

A snapshot with `external` set describes an engine PAIR never installs, starts
or stops — the user runs it in its own application, and PAIR only probes and
routes to the configured server port. Its `launchText` is empty, `editable` is
false, and the only meaningful change is `serverPort`: applying it persists
where PAIR probes and routes and re-probes, with no restart and no facade
choreography. `proxyPort` is not configurable — a facade-riding engine reports
the facade it rides (for `openai-compatible`, the Ollama proxy's port), and a
request that changes it is refused. Discovery and the proxy's local backend
reconcile through the regular advertise loop within one poll interval, so no
advertisement is suppressed during the apply.

Declared CORS origin lists, switches and explicit booleans can only change on
the engine's owning node. The broker derives an internal `preserveCORS` preview
guard from the authenticated caller, overriding any client-supplied value. It
rechecks canonical CORS policy under the apply lock before accepting a revision;
the early remote ingress check alone is insufficient when operations overlap.

## Ownership, ordering and failures

The node configuration mutex precedes engine operation locks. Worker dispatch
is asynchronous; neither stdio reader waits for an operation. The broker holds
the node lock across validation, journal acceptance and application. The worker
holds its engine lock across override persistence, stopping with the old launch
context, installing the new context, the narrow proxy rebind callback and one
start/readiness wait. The callback validates an active operation token and
acquires no node configuration lock. Legacy public port setters enter this same
operation and retain their response shape. Legacy lifecycle port overrides and
automatic port reconciliation share the node lock and revision reconciliation.

Validate both ports together against the unchanged counterpart, registered
PAIR services, aliases, other configured engines/proxies and occupied listeners.
Only this engine's current running port and its proxy listener can be reused
for a swap. Revalidation happens at Apply; OS bind remains the final arbiter of
a competing process. Adopted process engines are read-only; command-mode
engines require their official stop path. A facade-riding engine and the facade
it rides share one proxy port by construction, so that equality is not treated
as a collision in either direction. A user-managed engine's server port is its
own server's listener: occupied there is the state PAIR adopts, not a conflict.

A normalized no-op changes no runtime. Proxy-only edits do not restart the
engine. A stopped engine remains stopped. Running launch/server changes stop
and start once without rewriting explicit enabled intent. Advertisements and
proxy upstream eligibility are disabled during application and restored only
after readiness. Polling advertisers share the node lock.

Validation, stale revisions and journal-write failures cause no runtime
mutation. Once accepted, desired settings remain saved if the engine or proxy
fails. The failed snapshot exposes actual runtime facts and the prior applied
revision; correction/retry is another explicit Apply. Component writes and OS
listeners are recoverable steps, not an ACID transaction. The failed snapshot
preserves the worker's error message. Settings-driven start failures use this
result instead of also raising global lifecycle errors. Normal start failures
still raise a lifecycle error; the exit watcher begins after readiness to avoid
reporting the same startup failure twice.

`engine-settings-operations.json` in the app data directory holds previous and
desired settings, revision, resume intent and operation receipts. Component
engine overrides and proxy-port files remain their owners' configuration.
Acceptance is written and synced before component changes. Interrupted applying
records replay before enabled-engine restoration. Explicit settings override
automatic facade defaults on later startup. Unreadable journal data is preserved
and suppresses automatic component rewrites. On first upgrade, a valid existing
proxy-port choice is preserved as explicit when it differs from the engine port
(except LM Studio's obsolete 1235 default). Old stores lack choice provenance,
so a historical automatic move is conservatively preserved too. Unreadable data
blocks automatic recovery. The journal retains up to 256 terminal receipts
per engine; evicted retries must still pass the original expected revision.

## Paired transport

The existing engine-control listener exposes pinned-mTLS POST endpoints
`/v1/engine-settings/get`, `/preview`, `/apply` and GET `/events`. Requests are
limited to 64 KiB and cannot forward another hop. The authenticated caller ID is
carried through correlated `engine:settings-request` / `engine:settings-reply`
notifications to the local broker. Cancellation and pin removal cancel queued
work; the broker rechecks the caller after acquiring the node lock. Once
durably accepted, the target completes under its own eleven-minute deadline even
if the initiating peer disconnects.

`engine:settings-projection` seeds the worker's subscription hub with full local
snapshots. A subscription registers and receives its baseline under one lock.
Slow readers coalesce full snapshots, avoiding missing-field patches. There are
at most 64 subscribers and 64 outbound peer streams. Each stream checks trust
on every frame/heartbeat, bounds writes to five seconds and emits one-second
heartbeats. Clients reconnect after disconnection and discard older sequences
within an epoch; a fresh authority epoch replaces the baseline. Settings never
enter mDNS/public discovery metadata. Older/offline/unpaired peers are read-only
with an explicit unavailable state in the editor.

## Validation

Tests cover literal argv, parser fuzz/table cases, managed-field validation,
real process no-op/proxy-only/launch changes, ownership rejection, persistence
failure, journal recovery, revision conflicts/deduplication, queued cancellation,
three-node pinned TLS subscriptions, revocation/reconnect, bounded slow readers,
proxy persistence failure preserving its listener, renderer ordering and log
redaction. The rendered editor is also exercised with isolated browser fixtures.
Native vendor and Linux/macOS runtime verification remain release-platform
checks; Windows fixture results do not certify vendor-option compatibility.
