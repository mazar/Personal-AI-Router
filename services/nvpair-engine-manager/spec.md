# Microservice: Engine Manager (`nvpair-engine-manager`)

## 1. Purpose
A declarative, config-driven control plane for **local inference engines** (Ollama and the user-managed OpenAI-compatible server today; Intel / llama.cpp / others later). It owns an engine's entire lifecycle *except serving inference* — locate, install, launch, stop, restart, health, and config-declared actions — so one uniform API manages any engine across OSes with no per-engine code. A third party drops in a JSON manifest and their engine's install/launch/controls "just appear" over the same API: the core extensibility story for an open-source product. An `external`-mode manifest is the degenerate case of this ownership: the engine is user-managed and PAIR owns nothing — it probes the configured port and reports what answers.

## 2. Scope
**In scope**
- Broker-coordinated argument/server/proxy settings, literal argument
  persistence, ownership validation and pinned peer settings synchronization.
  The normative operation and failure contract is
  [ENGINE_SETTINGS.md](../nvpair-ui-broker/ENGINE_SETTINGS.md); launch grammar is
  [LAUNCH_TEXT.md](LAUNCH_TEXT.md).
- Detect installation; **user-mode** install (HTTPS download + checksum-verify-when-pinned + run) per OS/arch.
- Lifecycle: start (with readiness probe), stop, restart, status, periodic health.
- Persistent server-port changes preserve arguments, environment and unrelated
  manifest overrides. Resetting to the bundled port removes only shared and
  host-platform port overrides, deleting the file only when it has no other
  settings. Host-platform precedence must not override a successfully saved port
  on reload; malformed existing overrides fail the save and remain intact.
- Config-declared **actions** covering the full model lifecycle — Ollama: `list_models`, `loaded_models`, `pull_model`, `run_model`, `unload_model`, `delete_model`; LM Studio: `list_models`/`list_downloaded`, `loaded_models`, `pull_model`, `load_model`, `chat`, `unload_model`, `delete_model` (`remove_path` with `lms-disk-path` resolution) — mapped to each engine's local control API. `loaded_models` reports the models currently resident in memory (Ollama `GET /api/ps`, LM Studio `GET /api/v1/models` filtered by nonempty `loaded_instances`), name-extracted via the same declarative `result` spec (with an optional `match` row filter).
- Per-engine stdout/stderr log capture and structured operational error records, surfaced via the errors pipeline.
- A normalized node-level model list (`engine:models`): union of every running engine's `list_models`, name-extracted via each action's declarative `result` spec, plus the per-engine set of models loaded in memory (`loadedByEngine`, from each engine's `loaded_models` action). A successful explicit empty inventory remains an engine key with `[]`; a missing/malformed/failed inventory omits that engine key instead of being mislabeled as authoritative empty. A watcher polls the loaded set and pushes `engine:models-changed` when it changes (explicit load/unload, JIT auto-load, TTL/idle eviction).
- Expose all of the above over the `engine:*` JSON-RPC surface to whatever orchestrates the service, plus an optional plain-HTTP LAN endpoint (`--http-port`, `GET /v1/models`) that serves the model list to a peer's discovery daemon (the list moved off the size-limited mDNS TXT onto HTTP).

**Out of scope**
- **Inference traffic** — stays with `nvpair-proxy`; this service never proxies `/api/chat` etc.
- **Multi-instance per engine and an MCP server** — future-additive, not v1.
- **The node's error list** — owned by `nvpair-errors`, which holds it as in-memory session state; this service only emits `errors:report` / `errors:clear`.

## 3. Key Use Cases
- **Install an engine, user-mode**: `engine:install {engine:"ollama"}` downloads the per-OS user-scoped package (Windows/Linux standalone archive extracted into a user dir; macOS app bundle — never an elevated `Setup.exe` or `curl | sh`), checksum-verifies, extracts, re-detects.
- **Run lifecycle**: `engine:start` / `engine:stop` / `engine:restart` / `engine:status`, with readiness and health probes against the engine's loopback port.
- **Run a declared action**: `engine:action {engine, action, params}` → the manifest-declared HTTP call to the engine's loopback control API (e.g. `127.0.0.1:{port}/api/pull`). (Methods, notifications, and UI events all use the colon form `engine:*`, matching the POC UI and the `errors:*` notifications.)
- **Route to a user-managed engine (`external` runtime)**: the OpenAI-compatible server is started and stopped in its own application — never by this service. `engine:install` is satisfied without a download (nothing to install; status always reports installed), `engine:start` succeeds by probing the configured port and adopting whatever identifies or answers there, and refuses with the user-managed reason while nothing does — without raising a start-failed service error, because a not-yet-started server is an expected state at restore. `engine:stop` on an adopted external engine is the ordinary foreign-process refusal (PAIR owns no process), and `StopAll` skips it. `engine:set-port` is the one settings write that exists: it persists the port override and re-probes, with no process bounce — this is how the user tells PAIR a server moved. Launch state reports `external:true, editable:false` with an empty launch text, and previews accept a server-port-only change.
- **Onboard a new engine (no code)**: a vendor adds `engines/<vendor>.json`; the generic runner exposes their lifecycle + actions immediately.
- **Edge case — already installed**: detect short-circuits install (idempotent).
- **Edge case — checksum mismatch**: install fails before `run`, is reported, and never executes an unverified payload.
- **Edge case — readiness timeout / crash**: failed readiness returns to Stopped; a later crash flips health and is reported.

## 4. Open Questions / Risks
- **`engine:*` method stability**: the Broker forwards the namespace verbatim; evolve it additively and preserve `engine:get-installed` as the installed-engine query.
- **`severity` / `action` enums**: current wire values are `info|warning|error` and `dismiss|retry|none`; coordinate any future shared-enum expansion without changing existing values.
- **Risk — auto-restart policy**: off by default (opt-in manifest flag); revisit once a supervisor / Warden-equivalent exists.
- **Risk — dynamic port assignment**: manifest `port: 0` reserves the option; range/policy TBD (may move to a future supervisor).
- **Risk — admin-only installers**: `mode: "admin"` is a flagged, refused exception, not the default; product direction is strictly user-mode.
- **Risk — LAN-open inference bind (interim)**: inference engines default `runtime.bind` to `0.0.0.0` (ordinary engines stay loopback; a per-call `bind` re-pins). This is a deliberate, temporary exception to the loopback-only posture; narrow it once authenticated inference transport exists. The engine-manager `ec` control surface is already protected independently by pin-based mTLS.
- **Future — declared/tunable env layer**: `runtime.env` is static today. A "declared tunables" layer (manifest-declared knobs, UI/broker-overridable per start) is worth adding; by env-richness the priority is Ollama → llama.cpp/Jan → vLLM (LM Studio / GPT4All are flags/settings-driven, not env). Related: `runtime.env` is process-mode-only — extending it to command-mode start commands is a deliberate, still-open choice. See `MANIFEST.md` → "Engine config reference".
- **Model deletion where the vendor has no command (LM Studio)**: implemented via the generic **`remove_path`** action kind — a manifest-declared, param-templated path the runner removes with safety rails (must resolve under a declared allowed root, reject `..`/symlink escapes). LM Studio's `delete_model` uses `model_resolution: "lms-disk-path"` to map logical ids to on-disk files via `lms ls --json` before deleting under `{models_dir}`, then `restart_after` to bounce a running server: LM Studio answers `/v1/models` from an index built at startup and exposes no rescan, so clients keep being offered the deleted model until it restarts. Ollama deletes via `DELETE /api/delete` (no restart needed) and ejects via `unload_model` (`POST /api/generate` with `keep_alive: 0`).

## 5. Requirements

**Functional**
- Load + validate per-engine JSON manifests (bundled + user dir); select the host `<goos>/<goarch>` block; resolve placeholders (`{bin}`, `{cli}`, `{port}`, `{download}`, `{install_dir}`).
- Support `process` (owned foreground), `command` (daemon + control-CLI), and `external` (user-managed: probe-only, no owned process, no stop) runtimes; execute detect / install / uninstall / start / stop / restart / status / health and HTTP **or** CLI actions; emit `engine:*` results and notifications.
- Emit `errors:report` / `errors:clear` on its stdio for the Broker to forward to `nvpair-errors`.

**Non-functional**
- Compiles and runs on Windows / macOS / Linux × amd64 / arm64.
- **User mode, no runtime admin/sudo**; stdio / `--ipc` is the primary control channel, with an optional plain-HTTP model-list listener and a clustered pin-gated mTLS control listener; engines bind loopback by default, but a manifest's `runtime.bind` can open an inference engine to the LAN (Ollama ships `0.0.0.0` to serve the cluster), overridable per-call via `engine:start {bind}`; HTTPS-only downloads, checksum-verified when the manifest pins a `sha256`.
- Fully testable end-to-end with no real engines, network, or installers in the test path.
- Small, readable, minimal-dependency.

## 6. Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs** — from the orchestrator (`nvpair-ui-broker`) over stdio / `--ipc`, plus engine manifests from disk. Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 `engine:*` requests; manifest JSON (`engine`, `display_name`, `manifest_version`, `platforms{<os/arch>{detect, install, runtime}}`, `actions`). Every manifest is validated on load and rejected with a specific, human-readable error if malformed; manifests are read-only to this service.

`EngineStatus` object (returned by `engine:status` and `engine:get-installed`):
```json
{
  engine: string
  display_name: string
  installed: boolean
  running: boolean
  healthy: boolean
  port: number
}
```

`LogLine` object (entry in `engine:logs`):
```json
{ time: string, stream: "stdout" | "stderr", text: string }
```

Errors are emitted with the `nvpair-shared/errors.ServiceError` wire shape (`id`, `message`, `severity`, `action`, …), mirrored locally in `reporter.go` with identical JSON tags. `id` follows `engine-manager:<class>:<engine>`; the Broker stamps `nodeId` / `timestamp`.

Example request:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"engine:install","params":{"engine":"ollama"}}
```

**Outputs** — JSON-RPC responses/notifications to the orchestrator; spawned engine OS processes; loopback HTTP to the engine's control API; `errors:report` / `errors:clear` notifications the Broker forwards to `nvpair-errors`. Lifecycle is not a hot path; error emits are best-effort (no-op if `nvpair-errors` is down). stdout writes are serialized so frames never interleave.

Example error notification:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"errors:report","params":{"id":"engine-manager:install-failed:ollama","message":"sha256 mismatch","severity":"error"}}
```

## 7. API / Interface Contract
The stdio interface toward the local orchestrator (`nvpair-ui-broker`) is the primary surface. In addition, a clustered node serves a cluster-scoped remote-control surface (the `ec` service) directly over pin-based mTLS — engine-manager terminates that mTLS itself (see §7.2), the one place inter-node crypto lives here rather than in the orchestrator.

### 7.0 Methods and notifications
All traffic is JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited over stdio (default) or `--ipc` (Unix domain socket / Windows named pipe).

Requests (caller → service):

| Method | Params | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `engine:get-installed` | — | `{ engines: [EngineStatus] }` |
| `engine:describe` | `{ engine }` | the engine's manifest |
| `engine:status` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:install` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after install) |
| `engine:uninstall` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after removal) |
| `engine:start` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after readiness) |
| `engine:stop` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:restart` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:action` | `{ engine, action, params }` | the engine's raw response |
| `engine:logs` | `{ engine }` | `{ lines: [LogLine] }` |
| `engine:errors` | — | `{ errors: [ServiceError] }` |
| `engine:remote-get-installed` | `{ node }` | `{ engines: [EngineStatus] }` from the remote node |
| `engine:remote-install` | `{ node, engine, start? }` | `{ opId, status }` after the remote install |
| `engine:remote-pull-model` | `{ node, engine, model?, params? }` | `{ opId, result }` after the remote pull |
| `engine:remote-load-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-unload-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-delete-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-start` | `{ node, engine, port? }` | `EngineStatus` from the remote node (manifest `runtime.bind`; no per-call bind on the remote path) |
| `engine:remote-stop` | `{ node, engine }` | `EngineStatus` from the remote node |
| `shutdown` | — | `null` |
| `log/set-level` | `{ level }` | `{ level }` |

Notifications (service → caller): `ready{version}`, `engine:state-changed{EngineStatus}`, `engine:models-changed{engine, models}` (pushed when an engine's loaded-in-memory model set changes; `models` is the full `engine:models` shape incl. `loadedByEngine`), `engine:install-progress{engine, stage, percent}`, `engine:pull-progress{engine, op, stage, percent, message}` (live progress for a local model pull driven via `engine:action{action:"pull_model"}` — the local counterpart of `engine:remote-progress`), `engine:remote-progress{opId, node, engine, op, stage, percent, message}` (live progress relayed from a remote install/pull), and `errors:report` / `errors:clear` (consumed by `nvpair-errors` via the Broker). `install` / `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `action` / `remote-*` each run in their own goroutine so the read loop never blocks; their responses arrive when the op completes.

Example `engine:install-progress` (stdout):
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"engine:install-progress","params":{"engine":"ollama","stage":"downloading","percent":42}}
```

Example `engine:pull-progress` (stdout):
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"engine:pull-progress","params":{"engine":"ollama","op":"pull","stage":"pulling","percent":62,"message":"pulling"}}
```

### 7.1 Versioning
- `engine:*` method names are namespaced and additive — new methods, never breaking changes to existing ones.
- `manifest_version` gates manifest-schema evolution: unknown optional fields are ignored (backward-compatible growth); a version higher than supported is rejected.

### 7.2 Remote engine management (the `ec` surface)
With `--control-port` and a clustered `--cluster-dir`, engine-manager serves a cluster-scoped remote-control surface over pin-based mTLS (`nvpair-shared/clustertrust`): it presents this node's cluster leaf, requires a client cert, and `403`s any caller that isn't a byte-for-byte pinned cluster peer. The listener is bound whenever `--control-port` is set and admits callers by live membership — its leaf is resolved per handshake, so an unclustered node presents none and every handshake is refused — so no restart is needed on `cluster:identity-changed`; the broker registers `ec` whenever a cluster dir is configured. Routes under `/v1`: `GET /engines`, streaming `POST /engines/install` and `/models/pull` (chunked NDJSON — zero+ `{"type":"progress"}` frames then one terminal `{"type":"result"}`/`{"type":"error"}` frame), non-streaming `POST /models/{load,unload,delete}`, and non-streaming `POST /engines/{start,stop}` returning `EngineStatus`.

The `engine:remote-*` methods are the client half: engine-manager resolves the target `node` in an `ec` peer directory (fed by its own `discovery:subscribe{services:[ec]}` to the broker relay), dials the peer's `ec` surface with the same pinned identity, relays each streamed progress frame up as `engine:remote-progress` (keyed by a minted `opId`), and settles the request on the terminal frame. Remote install/pull run for the operation's full duration (no broker-imposed timeout); remote stop and model unload/delete are fast request/response, remote Ollama model load uses the readiness-sized response budget, and remote start waits for the engine's bounded readiness result. They error if this node isn't clustered or the target isn't a pinned peer.

## 8. Dependencies
- **Upstream**: the orchestrator that spawns it and forwards `engine:*` (`nvpair-ui-broker`).
- **Downstream**: `nvpair-errors` (via the Broker's `errors:report` / `errors:clear` forwarding); the managed engine processes.
- **External**: engine vendors' download URLs (HTTPS; checksum-pinned when a `sha256` is set, else HTTPS-only with a warning); first-party `nvpair-shared/applog` (logging + `log/set-level`) and `nvpair-shared/clustertrust` (pin-based mTLS). The `nvpair-shared/errors` wire shape is mirrored locally with identical JSON tags. No third-party runtime services.

## 9. Data Ownership
- **Owned**: the in-memory engine registry (parsed manifests + per-engine runtime state) and per-engine log/error ring buffers — transient only.
- **Source of truth**: no — `nvpair-errors` owns the node's error list (in memory, for the session); model inventories belong to the engines; manifests on disk are authored elsewhere.
- **Storage**: in-memory; manifests read from the per-user data dir's `engines/*.json` (`%LocalAppData%\Nvidia Corporation\Personal AI Router` on Windows, `~/.config/Nvidia Corporation/Personal AI Router` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Nvidia Corporation/Personal AI Router` on macOS) plus bundled `manifests/*.json`. No database.

## 10. Design Constraints
- **Performance**: control plane, not inference; sub-second RPCs except install (network-bound) and start (bounded by the readiness timeout).
- **Scalability**: a handful of engines per node; one managed instance per engine in v1.
- **Reliability**: best-effort; readiness + health probes; automatic restart on crash is planned but **not yet implemented** (see §4); install is one-shot and idempotent (detect short-circuits).
- **Security**: **user mode only — no admin/sudo at runtime** (escalation reserved for product install time); both optional LAN listeners terminate pin-based mTLS and reject unpinned peers — the read-only model-list listener (`em`) because a node's model inventory is cluster data, and the `ec` control listener because its routes are privileged; `em` additionally serves plaintext on loopback only, for this node's own scanner; engines bind loopback by default, but a manifest's `runtime.bind` may open an inference engine to the LAN (Ollama defaults to `0.0.0.0`, overridable per-call); downloads are HTTPS-only (plain HTTP only from loopback) and checksum-verified before execution when the manifest pins a `sha256` (an unpinned fetch is HTTPS-only with a loud warning, like a `script` install).
- **Compliance**: no PII; payloads carry engine/model identifiers and error messages only.

## 11. Assumptions
- The orchestrator owns the stdio/IPC pipe and is the only peer; on parent exit (stdin EOF) the service shuts down cleanly — no reconnect or buffering.
- Manifests are either well-formed (validated) or rejected; authors keep `engine:*` and manifest shapes stable per the versioning rules.
- Engines bind loopback unless the manifest's `runtime.bind` opts otherwise (inference engines default to `0.0.0.0`; a per-call `bind` overrides); the engine's own startup banner is not trusted — the readiness probe confirms the actual bind.
- `nvpair-errors` is best-effort; its absence degrades to local logs only.

## 12. Failure Modes and Mitigations
- **Download / checksum failure on install**: engine stays NotInstalled. → Fail fast before `run`; `engine:install-progress` error + `errors:report` (`engine-manager:install-failed:<engine>`); never execute an unverified payload.
- **Engine fails its readiness probe**: start never reaches Running. → Bounded ready timeout → back to Stopped; structured error; no half-started state.
- **Engine process crashes**: engine unavailable. → A watcher flips state, emits `engine:state-changed` + `errors:report` (`engine-manager:exited:<engine>`); the parent's supervisor reports if the *manager itself* dies. (Automatic restart is planned — see §4 — not yet implemented.)
- **`nvpair-errors` unavailable**: failures absent from the node's error list. → The Broker no-ops the forward; local applog + ring buffers still hold everything.
- **Invalid / unknown-OS manifest**: that engine is unusable. → Reject at load with a specific error; other engines unaffected.

## 13. Observability
- **Logging**: structured `slog` to stderr via `nvpair-shared/applog` (captured by the parent's debug panel); per-engine stdout/stderr ring buffers; key events — install fetch/verify/run outcomes, start/ready/stop transitions, health flips, action invocations, every failure.
- **Metrics**: lightweight in-process counters (installs, starts, failures, health transitions per engine), surfaced via `engine:status` and `engine:errors`; no separate metrics endpoint in v1.
- **Alerts**: surfaced through the errors pipeline — `errors:report` for install/start/health failures and manager crashes; the UI's error list is the alerting surface for v1.

## 14. Sample usage
The operator opens the UI; the Broker calls `engine:get-installed`, which returns each manifest's `EngineStatus` (e.g. Ollama `installed:true, running:false`). To set up a missing engine, the Broker sends `engine:install {engine:"ollama"}`: the service downloads the per-OS user-scoped package, checksum-verifies it, runs it user-mode, and re-detects — progress streaming as `engine:install-progress` notifications.

The operator starts it: `engine:start {engine:"ollama"}` resolves the manifest runtime (`OLLAMA_HOST` = `{host}:{port}`, `{host}` from `runtime.bind` defaulting to `0.0.0.0`; per-call `port`/`bind` override either), spawns the process, and waits for the readiness probe before reporting `running:true, healthy:true` in the response and an `engine:state-changed` notification. A periodic health probe keeps the state current; an unexpected exit emits `engine:state-changed` + `errors:report`. If something is already serving the port, `start` **adopts** it instead of spawning a duplicate.

The operator stops it: `engine:stop {engine:"ollama"}` signals a process the service owns. For an **adopted** engine (no owned process), it resolves the PID bound to the port and terminates it only when that process is running the binary we manage — reclaiming an orphan a prior run left on our own managed port; a genuinely foreign listener (a different image on a different port) is declined with an error naming its PID and image. A user-initiated `stop` records the OFF intent regardless (even when the RPC returns an error), so the health loop and restore-on-restart don't flip the engine back on — clients must not treat a stop error as proof the OFF choice was discarded. The cluster `ec` stop endpoint shares this semantics and may return HTTP 500 while OFF is persisted.

The operator pulls a model: `engine:action {engine:"ollama", action:"pull_model", params:{name:"llama3.2"}}` issues the manifest-declared `POST 127.0.0.1:{port}/api/pull`. Because the action is `pull_model`, the request is routed through the streaming pull path (not the buffered `engine:action` reader): each `/api/pull` status line is emitted as an `engine:pull-progress` notification — so a local pull shows live download progress just like a remote pull's `engine:remote-progress` — and the request settles with the pull's terminal result line. Frames are coalesced (only a change in `stage` or `percent` is emitted) so a chatty engine that streams many byte-progress lines per layer doesn't flood subscribers. The engine's terminal `{"status":"success"}` surfaces as a `stage:"success"` frame; a **failed** pull emits a terminal `stage:"error", percent:-1, message:<why>` frame in addition to the JSON-RPC error, so a UI whose synchronous call already timed out on a long download still converges off "pulling". A CLI-driven pull (LM Studio's `lms get`) has no line-level progress, so it emits one `stage:"pulling"` marker and returns the command's result. On `shutdown` (or stdin EOF) the service stops every running engine first, so none are orphaned.

The user-managed OpenAI-compatible server skips all of that: the operator starts `vllm serve` (or any OpenAI-compatible server) in its own terminal, and the health probe flips the engine to `running` within one poll interval once `GET /v1/models` answers on the configured port. Nothing is ever spawned, moved, or signalled; when the user stops the server, the probe clears `running` and the models leave the inventory until it returns.

## 15. Current integration / wiring

The engine manager builds standalone (`go build ./...`) and is tested end to
end over stdio. Current product wiring is:

1. `build.bat` and `build.sh` build the version from `versions.json` and stage
   the binary in the repository-root `build/bin/` bundle.
2. `installer/nvpair-setup.nsi` bundles the Windows binary and owns the local
   subnet firewall rules for its model-list and cluster-control listeners.
3. `nvpair-ui-broker` supervises the process, relays its `engine:*` JSON-RPC
   surface, forwards engine events and errors, and registers its applicable
   discovery services.
4. The bundled graphical UI, `nvpair-tui`, and other clients use the broker
   contract rather than owning engine-manager process wiring. Product packaging
   places the graphical UI alongside the broker and workers in the same
   installation directory.
5. `nvpair-engine-manager/README.md`, `nvpair-ui-broker/README.md`, and the
   cross-process tests are the current architecture, protocol, and
   integration references.

The retired desktop wiring is intentionally omitted; its implementation record
remains available in Git history and is not part of the current architecture.
